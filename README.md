# 50 Vanilla JS Exercises

## Description

This project is a collection of 50 exercises designed to help me improve my JavaScript skills. The exercises cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax and data types to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming and asynchronous programming.

Each exercise is designed to be completed in Vanilla JS, meaning that no external libraries or frameworks are required. This is to encourage a deeper understanding of the core JavaScript language and to help me develop my problem-solving skills.
